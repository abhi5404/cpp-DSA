# C++ Data Structures and Algorithms

This repository contains a comprehensive collection of C/C++ programs covering fundamental data structures and algorithms concepts. It serves as a learning resource and reference for anyone studying DSA and competitive programming.

## 📚 Topics Covered

### Basics
- **INTRODUCTION**: Fundamental C programs including basic I/O, data types, and simple calculations
- **IF_ELSE**: Conditional statements and decision-making programs
- **LOOPS**: Iterative constructs and loop-based problems
- **FUNCTIONS**: Function declarations, definitions, and modular programming

### Data Structures
- **ARRAY**: Array manipulation, searching, sorting, and classic problems (Kadane's algorithm, stock buy/sell, trapping rainwater)
- **2D ARRAY**: Matrix operations and two-dimensional array problems
- **CHAR ARRAY & STRING**: Character arrays, string manipulation, and string algorithms
- **STRINGS**: Advanced string operations and problems

### Algorithms
- **SEARCHING**: Linear search and binary search implementations
- **SORTING**: Various sorting algorithm implementations
- **RECURSION**: Recursive problem-solving techniques

### Practice
- **PATTERN & PRINTING**: Pattern printing problems for logic building
- **PRACTICE (ROUGH)**: Experimental and practice code

## 🎯 Purpose

This repository is designed to:
- Provide clear implementations of fundamental DSA concepts
- Help students and developers prepare for technical interviews
- Serve as a quick reference for common algorithms and data structures
- Build problem-solving skills through hands-on coding

## 🚀 Getting Started

Each folder contains C/C++ source files that can be compiled and executed independently. Most programs include:
- Clear problem descriptions in comments
- Well-structured code implementations
- Example test cases

To compile and run any program:
```bash
g++ filename.cpp -o filename
./filename
```

## 📝 Note

This is a learning repository containing implementations of classic DSA problems and concepts. Feel free to explore, learn, and contribute!
